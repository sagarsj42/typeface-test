We can use an RDBMS to save the monitoring data.
Given requirement: 100 API, 1000 users
We have 1 M requests / day


API_MNTR (
  uid INT,          -- user id
  api INT,           -- name of the api (unique)
  requested_at DATETIME,   -- timestamp of the request
  served_in FLOAT,          -- duration needed to serve req
)

We can use SQL queries to get the necessary parameters
For max response time api:

SELECT api, AVG(served_in) AS avg_response_time
FROM API_MNTR
GROUP BY api
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
LIMIT 1;
